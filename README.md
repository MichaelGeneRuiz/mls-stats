# MLS Stats
This site was created using Next-JS, Bootstrap, Chart.JS, and MongoDB.

# Explanation
This site interacts with the API Sports football API to pull information for the MLS. When this information is pulled, it is stored onto a MongoDB database. The pages for this website are rendered using server-side rendering. New data is pulled from the API 
every hour for the standings and every 24 hours for the team stats.
